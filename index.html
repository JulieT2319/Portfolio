                I graduated from Brigham Young University in 2011. After graduation I took a job
                at a local market research firm, where I was quickly promoted to Lead Programmer.

                I have always loved puzzles and problem solving, particularly logic based puzzles.
                My hobbies are reading, cross stitching, and gaming of all kinds. Currently my 
                favorite author is Brandon Sanderson.

                Coding and programming have been an interest of mine since my teens. My first project
                was customizing a myspace page in all the glory that was early 2000s teen html knowledge. 
                It was a music playing pink webpage that I truly wish I still had evidence of.
