        <img src="assets/images/julie.jpg" alt="head shot of Julie">
        <p>I graduated from Brigham Young University in 2011. After graduation I took a job
            at a local market research firm, where I was quickly promoted to Lead Programmer.
        </p>
        <p>I have always loved puzzles and problem solving, particularly logic based puzzles.
            My hobbies are reading, cross stitching, and gaming of all kinds. Currently my 
            favorite author is Brandon Sanderson.
        </p>
        <p>Coding and programming have been an interest of mine since my teens. My first project
            was customizing a myspace page in all the glory that was early 2000s teen html knowledge. 
            It was a music playing pink webpage that I truly wish I still had evidence of.
